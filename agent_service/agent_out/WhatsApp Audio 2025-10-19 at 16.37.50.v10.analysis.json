  "summary": "<details>\n<summary>Conversation Summary</strong></summary>\n\n*   **Call Purpose:** Sales call regarding the Shehal remote cardiac monitoring service for a prospect awaiting bypass surgery.\n*   **Prospect Profile:** 59-year-old, lives alone, has four arterial blockages, awaiting a surgery date.\n*   **Main Product Presented:** **Shehal** remote cardiac monitoring service.\n    *   Includes a portable ECG device that transmits data in 12 seconds.\n    *   Includes a **troponin biomarker test** (Shehal's biomarker) for early heart attack detection.\n    *   Service triggers an ambulance dispatch if abnormalities are detected.\n*   **Key Value Proposition:** Provides peace of mind and rapid intervention. As a Shehal subscriber, a patient arrives at the hospital with pre-transmitted data (ECG, troponin results), bypassing triage delays for faster treatment and better outcomes.\n*   **Prospect's Main Objections:**\n    *   \"I don't want [the service], my friends are bothering me, I'm not interested.\"\n    *   \"I have no medical problem right now.\"\n    *   Concern about cost: \"How much will this cost me? I assume it's free?... Nothing is free.\"\n*   **Sales Arguments Used:**\n    *   Emphasized the \"golden hour\" for intervention.\n    *   Contrasted experience: long ER wait times vs. immediate catheterization for Shehal members.\n    *   Stated that cost is irrelevant when it saves lives.\n    *   Provided social proof: Shehal's client base is now younger (average age 45-50).\n    *   Cited a recent high-profile case (hinted) where timely intervention led to a full recovery.\n*   **Prospect's Stated Understanding:** Acknowledged the logical arguments (\"You are right,\" \"I agree with you\") but maintained initial hesitation based on current perceived lack of need.\n\n</details>\n\n**Next steps**\n\n*   A Shehal representative will call the prospect **today** to provide detailed cost information and membership terms.\n*   The prospect agreed to receive this call.\n*   No commitment to purchase was made during this call; the next step is purely informational.\n*   A free, non-binding home demonstration was offered for a future date if the prospect decides to proceed after reviewing the costs.",
