<summary>Conversation Summary</strong></summary>

*   **Call Purpose:** Sales call regarding the Shehal remote cardiac monitoring service for a prospect awaiting bypass surgery.
*   **Prospect Profile:** 59-year-old, lives alone, has four arterial blockages, awaiting a surgery date.
*   **Main Product Presented:** **Shehal** remote cardiac monitoring service.
    *   Includes a portable ECG device that transmits data in 12 seconds.
    *   Includes a **troponin biomarker test** (Shehal's biomarker) for early heart attack detection.
    *   Service triggers an ambulance dispatch if abnormalities are detected.
*   **Key Value Proposition:** Provides peace of mind and rapid intervention. As a Shehal subscriber, a patient arrives at the hospital with pre-transmitted data (ECG, troponin results), bypassing triage delays for faster treatment and better outcomes.
*   **Prospect's Main Objections:**
    *   "I don't want [the service], my friends are bothering me, I'm not interested."
    *   "I have no medical problem right now."
    *   Concern about cost: "How much will this cost me? I assume it's free?... Nothing is free."
*   **Sales Arguments Used:**
    *   Emphasized the "golden hour" for intervention.
    *   Contrasted experience: long ER wait times vs. immediate catheterization for Shehal members.
    *   Stated that cost is irrelevant when it saves lives.
    *   Provided social proof: Shehal's client base is now younger (average age 45-50).
    *   Cited a recent high-profile case (hinted) where timely intervention led to a full recovery.
*   **Prospect's Stated Understanding:** Acknowledged the logical arguments ("You are right," "I agree with you") but maintained initial hesitation based on current perceived lack of need.
