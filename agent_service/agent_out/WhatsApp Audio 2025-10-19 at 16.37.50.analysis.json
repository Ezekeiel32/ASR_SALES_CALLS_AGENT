  "summary": "### Call Summary\n\n*   **Product Discussed:** Remote cardiac monitoring service (\"שחל\" - Shahal). The full name mentioned is \"שחל תל הרפואה\" (Shahal Tel Harfuah), emphasizing it is remote medicine. The service includes continuous ECG monitoring and troponin biomarker tests for early detection of cardiac events.\n*   **Customer Profile:** A 59-year-old individual with four arterial blockages, awaiting bypass surgery. Current vital signs (ECG, blood pressure) are reported as normal. Lives alone.\n*   **Key Quotes (Original Language):**\n    *   Sales Rep: \"שחל שלום בבד ג'נע שעלה זו.\" (Opening greeting)\n    *   Customer: \"יש לי ארבע סתימות בעורקים, שאני מעועד למעקפים.\" (\"I have four blockages in my arteries and am awaiting bypasses.\")\n    *   Customer: \"אני לא רוצה, אני משגעים אותי חברים שכם, אני לא מלא.\" (\"I don't want [it], my friends are bothering me, I'm not full/convinced.\") - indicating initial resistance.\n    *   Sales Rep: \"ברגע שזה מציל חיים.\" (\"The moment it saves lives.\") - highlighting the core value proposition.\n    *   Customer (on cost): \"יש פה משהו בחינם?\" (\"Is there something here for free?\") followed by \"אין פה שום דבר בחינם.\" (\"There is nothing here for free.\") - acknowledging the service is paid.\n*   **Objections Handled:**\n    *   **Perceived Need:** Customer repeatedly states he knows his condition and feels no immediate need (\"אני יודע מה המצב שלי\", \"I know my situation\"). Sales rep counters by explaining the service is for prevention and early intervention, especially critical given his pending surgery.\n    *   **Cost Concern:** Customer inquires if the service is free. Sales rep clarifies it is not but frames the cost against the value of saving lives and avoiding severe health complications.\n    *   **Location/Logistics:** Customer initially asked if there is a service point nearby (\"איפה יש לכם משהו קרוב אלינו?\"). Sales rep explained the service is entirely remote and location-independent.\n*   **Commitments:** Customer agreed to a meeting with a company representative for a demonstration, acknowledging the explanation (\"הבנתי\" - \"I understand\").\n*   **Pricing Discussion:** The cost was not specified numerically. The sales rep focused on the value proposition rather than quoting a price, stating it's an investment in health.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n*   Schedule a visit from a Shahal representative to demonstrate the service and explain usage. A tentative time of \"today at 5 PM\" was discussed but not firmly confirmed.\n*   The representative will contact the customer to finalize the appointment details.\n*   No specific follow-up date was set during the call. The sales rep should coordinate the meeting time.",
