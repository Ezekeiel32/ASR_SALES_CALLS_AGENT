build a Hebrew meeting Summarizer, AI powered, to record and transcribe the entire meeting, via ivrit.AI, have deepseek summarize it, and the system will be speaker aware by  based on the Ivrit.ai speaker diferentiation, and pyannote etc. This is a critical and IMPORTANT, INNOVATIVE IDEA I HAVE, FOR TRUE SPEAKER AWARENESS FOR TRUE SPEAKER NAME AWARENESS IN SUMMARY AND STORAGE OF MEETING TRANSCRIPTION WITH REAL NAMES: THE MOMENT THE MEETING IS ENDED, THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE 15 SECOND SNIPPETS OF EACH DETECTED SPEAKER, AND THE USER WLL ASSIGN THE EXAT NAME ASSIGNED TO THAT VOICE. The voice recognition system will then be able to automatically detect and remember, each user that was previously assigned. IF THE SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED THEIR NAMES THROUGHOUT THE MEETING, THE SYSTEM WHICH ASSIGNS NAMES, WILL SUGGEST THE MENTIONED NAME, AT THE END OF THE MEETING, WITH THE ASSOCIATED VOICE, AS THE SPEAKERS NAME (the detected nae will remain editable in this phase) and if we have to use some kind of advanced (BUT MINI) voice detection model, aside from ivrit.ai, lmk. Aside from that, the implementaition plan needs to be based exactly on the proposal, with a state of the art B2B-SaaS Israeli SOTA feel, look and build.
